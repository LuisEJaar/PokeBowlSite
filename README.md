# PokePalace
This project was one that I created while learning bootstrap for the first time. All associated images are credited to storyset.com. I wanted to play with the idea of a restaurant that serves one of my favorite foods, Poke Bowls!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

The site itself was coded with guidance from traversymedia in which they cover the basics of bootstrap. I put some of my own flair into it and made a shoutout to a wonderful bakery in New Orleans by the name of Dong Phuong in the map.

## Optimizations

- Implementation of a recipe or menu page
- Implementation of a payment order flow

## Lessons Learned:

This was my very first time even looking at bootstrap, a CSS framework, or even touching a CDN so there were plenty of firsts.
