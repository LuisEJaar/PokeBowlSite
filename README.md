# My Awesome Project
This project was one that I created while learning bootstrap for the first time. All associated images are credited to storyset.com.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

The site itself was coded alongside with inspiration and guidance from traversymedia in which they cover the basics of bootstrap. I put some of my own flair into it and made a shoutout to a wonderful bakery in New Orleans by the name of Dong Phuong.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Implementation of a recipe page
Implementation of a payment order flow

## Lessons Learned:

This was my very first time even looking at bootstrap, a CSS framework, or even touching a CDN so there were plenty of firsts.
